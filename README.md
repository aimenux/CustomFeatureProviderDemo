# CustomFeatureProviderDemo
```
Using custom feature provider in order to read features
```

> In this demo, i m using a [custom feature provider](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet#custom-feature-providers) in order to read features from in-memory storage and not from json file (which is the default behaviour).
>
> In addition to the custom feature provider, i m using a [custom feature snapshot](https://github.com/microsoft/FeatureManagement-Dotnet#snapshot) in order to prevent inconsistency of feature value during a single request.
